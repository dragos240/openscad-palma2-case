# openscad-palma2-case
Case for the Palma 2, written in OpenSCAD

## Overview

This OpenSCAD project can produce 2 different kinds of STLs:
- A backed case (this is the default)
- A bumper case (case without a back, just sides, so you can see the back of the device still)

To create the bumper version, set `printBackplate` to `true`.
